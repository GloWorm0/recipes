Ingredients:
 - 1 c. almond meal
 - scant 1/4 t. sea salt
 - 1/8 t. baking soda
 - 1/4 t. cinnamon, optional, but delicious!
 - 3 T. coconut oil or butter, melted
 - 2 T. honey or maple syrup
 - 1 1/2 t. vanilla
 - 1/2-1 t. water, only if/as needed
 - 2-4 T. chopped dark chocolate, depending on your personal preference (I usually use 3 T.)

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

2. Mix the almond meal, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon.

3. Stir in the coconut oil, honey/maple syrup, and vanilla.

4. Add in water as needed to bring everything together.

5. Stir in the chopped chocolate last.

6. Bake for 10-11 minutes on a well oiled or parchment paper-lined cookie sheet (the edges should be golden).

7. Let them sit on the pan for 5-10 minutes (they firm up during this time, so this is an important step!).

8. Remove and enjoy!
